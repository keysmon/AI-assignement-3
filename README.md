Snakes and Ladder - Bayesian Network - HMM


The assignment structure is as follows :

1. Snakes and ladder simulation (Basic) - basic rolling and movement simulation, no ladders/snakes
2. Snakes and ladder simulation (Basic) - multiple simulations and recording of number of rolls
3. Snakes and ladder simulation (Expected) - adding user-specified ladders/snakes
4. Snakes and ladder simulation (Expected) - simulation to determine the probability distribution of the number of rolls
5. Snakes and ladder simulation (Advanced) - exact inference + simulation with different ending rules
6. Specifying a Bayesian network 
7. Inference on a Bayesian network
8. Specifying a Hidden Markov Model 
9. Inference and estimation using HMM 
10. HMM with continuous observations (Gaussian Mixture Model) for location tracking
